This project is part of the Go codelab for Google I/O 2013 called "Whispering Gophers: networking programming in Go"

Go is an exciting new programming language with a concurrency model that makes network programming fun and straightforward. In this codelab you'll build a peer-to-peer chat network to communicate with your fellow attendees, giving you hands-on experience with Go's concurrency primitives and standard library.
